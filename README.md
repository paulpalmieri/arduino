# arduino
Contains code snippets to do various things on the ATMega328P microcontroller

The Arduino Nano is a very cheap board and a really good way to learn about embedded systems.
Note that most of the code does not use any arduino libraries and that you must refer to the datasheet to learn about the registers and details of the microcontroller.
