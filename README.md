Code snippets to be used on the ATMega328P microcontroller.

No libraries are used, bare-metal C code.

The __Arduino Nano__ is a very cheap board and a really good way to learn more about embedded systems, I broke a few of them while experimenting.

The datasheet is the best resource to learn about the details of the microcontroller.
